This project is deprecated. I wrote this script about two years ago, as (at the time) no existing programs had proper chording support. Now, at last, [kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) has gotten satisfactory chording support, which is what I am currently using.

# Slambda

This is a scuffed script for binding keys to chords of other keys.

To use this, just install it like any other flake. For options, check [the nixos module](./nixos-module.nix). You can check [my config](https://github.com/Mateiadrielrafael/everything-nix/blob/1103b38c5de11edbc94fe33e45cb2645d43d72ef/hosts/nixos/common/optional/services/slambda.nix) as an example.
